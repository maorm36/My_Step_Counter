This is a lightweight, real-time step counter designed for reliable everyday walking and running.
It combines the phone’s hardware step sensors (when available) with a calibrated accelerometer fallback so your steps are counted even on devices without a hardware pedometer.
A foreground service keeps tracking stable during screen-off to enable multitasking outside the app.
Moreover, mode detection is implemented in order to identify the activity of the user based on the sensors values.
